# [Machine Learning by Stanford University (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/)
This repository contains all the programming assignmets, quizzes, and lecture materials of the course Machine Learning taught by Andrew Ng on Coursera. After completion of this cousre you will have a intermediate level idea of some common machine learning algorithms and how it works. I will suggest to solve your assignments and quizzes on your own first but if you get stuck feel free to browse my codes and understand how it works.
